#Angular 2 Components
This is the code repository for [Angular 2 Components](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angular-2-components?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785882340), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.
Inside the folder, you will see ng_components folder. Copy all the contents of this folder to your source folder.
Please note that you will need to generate the node_modules folder using the npm command as given in the chapter content.
Each chapter has multiple coding examples and therefore previous coding example have been commented out to stop interference with newer examples.
Readers are requested to uncomment/comment out these examples accordingly for their execution. 
Also note that Chapter 3 does not have a code bundle since the coding examples used in this chapter are general syntaxes used explanation purposes only, further chapters have examples based on this chapter.

The code will look like the following:
```
class Product {
  private id: number;
  private color: string;
  constructor(id:number, color:string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.color = color;
  }
}
```

You need to know how to read and write JavaScript. Other technologies, such as C# or Java, may help you understand the syntax, but are not mandatory. Some experience with web development and related technologies such as HTML and CSS is required, so make sure you are familiar with that.
